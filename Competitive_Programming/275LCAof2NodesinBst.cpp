// IMPORTANT DEFINTION OF LCA :- Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

//  Here the time Complexity will be O(h);

// Approach:- For Binary search tree, while traversing the tree from top to bottom the first node which lies in between the two numbers n1 and n2 is the LCA of the nodes, i.e. the first node n with the lowest depth which lies in between n1 and n2 (n1<=n<=n2) n1 < n2.
// So just recursively traverse the BST in, if node's value is greater than both n1 and n2 then our LCA lies in the left side of the node, if it's is smaller than both n1 and n2, then LCA lies on the right side.
// Otherwise, the root is LCA (assuming that both n1 and n2 are present in BST).
