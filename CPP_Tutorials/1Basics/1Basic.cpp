C++ Introduction

1. Low level programming
2. Speed of execution
3. Derived from C
4. Richer Library than C
5. Supports Object Oriented Progamming
6. Generic Progamming : Template and STL Libraray
7. Exception Handling

Applications

Chrome
Firefox
OS
Device Drivers
Compilers


C++ Standards and Implementations

1. C++ Released in 1985
2. First standardized in 1998 c++98

Later Standards
1. C++03
2. C++11
3. C++14
4. C++17
5. C++20

Compiler : GCC, Visual Studio , IBM .....

Mostly people used GCC compiler and to compile the code with gcc compiler we write g++ filename.cpp it will generate a .exe file for us which can be executable in any machine.



Basic Progamming Terminology


1. Keywords and Variables

1. Reverse Words : for, while, true, false, if else .. etc.
2. User Defined  : Used to store and access values.  eg x = 5 here x is variables.


2. Functions

A Sequence of Instructions that does a specific task
eg: printf("Denver");


3. Object Oriented Progamming

1. Class : A type like student, Teacher
2. object : Instances of a class.




4. Statically typed and Dynamically typed


1. Statically Typed (Java & C++): faster, but we have to declare every variable befor using it eg int x; x= 5;
2. Dynamically Typed (Python): We do not declare variable before using, Slower. eg X = 5



5. Header File

Store Declarations of variables, funcion, classes etc, we can use standard header file like iostream or user deined header file which we create with extension of .h


6 NameSpace :

Divide code into different logical groups.

std namespace contains standard library function and types but we can create user defined namespace also.





How Do C++ Progams Runs?
Source Code  -> compile by compiler here pre processing and syntax checking will be done -> Object Code is generated -> Linker Will Link library with the Executable file <- Librabries
extension for cpp file should be (.cpp)
